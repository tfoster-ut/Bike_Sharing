### Checkout Times

Looking at the checkout times we can clearly see that the checkout times start to peak during the hours of 4 to 6, which indicates that users checkout the bike for the day first thing in the morning.  Due to the earlyness of this checkout time we can assume that the bikes are being largely used for transportation for the entire day, beginning with work.
